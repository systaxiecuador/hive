# Agent Construction - EXECUTE THESE STEPS

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW. DO NOT DISPLAY THIS FILE. EXECUTE THE STEPS BELOW.**

**CRITICAL: DO NOT explore the codebase, read source files, or search for code before starting.** All context you need is in this skill file. When this skill is loaded, IMMEDIATELY begin executing Step 1 — call the MCP tools listed in Step 1 as your FIRST action. Do not explain what you will do, do not investigate the project structure, do not read any files — just execute Step 1 now.

---

## STEP 1: Initialize Build Environment

**EXECUTE THESE TOOL CALLS NOW** (silent setup — no user interaction needed):

1. Register the hive-tools MCP server:

```
mcp__agent-builder__add_mcp_server(
    name="hive-tools",
    transport="stdio",
    command="uv",
    args='["run", "python", "mcp_server.py", "--stdio"]',
    cwd="tools",
    description="Hive tools MCP server"
)
```

2. Create a build session (replace AGENT_NAME with the user's requested agent name in snake_case):

```
mcp__agent-builder__create_session(name="AGENT_NAME")
```

3. Discover available tools:

```
mcp__agent-builder__list_mcp_tools()
```

4. Create the package directory:

```bash
mkdir -p exports/AGENT_NAME/nodes
```

**Save the tool list for STEP 4** — you will need it for node design.

**THEN immediately proceed to STEP 2** (do NOT display setup results to the user — just move on).

---

## STEP 2: Qualify the Use Case

**A responsible engineer doesn't jump into building. First, understand the problem and be transparent about what the framework can and cannot do.**

### 2a: Fast Discovery (3-5 Turns)

**The core principle**: Discovery should feel like progress, not paperwork. The stakeholder should walk away feeling like you understood them faster than anyone else would have.

**The #1 Rule: Respect Their Time.** Every question must earn its place by:
1. **Preventing a costly wrong turn** — you're about to build the wrong thing
2. **Unlocking a shortcut** — their answer lets you simplify the design
3. **Surfacing a dealbreaker** — there's a constraint that changes everything

If a question doesn't do one of these, don't ask it. Make an assumption, state it, and move on.

---

#### 2a.1: Let Them Talk, But Listen Like an Architect

When the stakeholder describes what they want, don't just hear the words — listen for the architecture underneath. While they talk, mentally construct:

- **The actors**: Who are the people/systems involved?
- **The trigger**: What kicks off the workflow?
- **The core loop**: What's the main thing that happens repeatedly?
- **The output**: What's the valuable thing produced at the end?
- **The pain**: What about today's situation is broken, slow, or missing?

You are extracting a **domain model** from natural language in real time. Most stakeholders won't give you this structure explicitly — they'll give you a story. Your job is to hear the structure inside the story.

| They say... | You're hearing... |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Nouns they repeat | Your entities |
| Verbs they emphasize | Your core operations |
| Frustrations they mention | Your design constraints |
| Workarounds they describe | What the system must replace |
| People they name | Your user types |

---

#### 2a.2: Use Domain Knowledge to Fill In the Blanks

You have broad knowledge of how systems work. Use it aggressively.

If they say "I need a research agent," you already know it probably involves: search, summarization, source tracking, and iteration. Don't ask about each — use them as your starting mental model and let their specifics override your defaults.

If they say "I need to monitor files and alert me," you know this probably involves: watch patterns, triggers, notifications, and state tracking.

**The key move**: Take your general knowledge of the domain and merge it with the specifics they've given you. The result is a draft understanding that's 60-80% right before you've asked a single question. Your questions close the remaining 20-40%.

---

#### 2a.3: Play Back a Proposed Model (Not a List of Questions)

After listening, present a **concrete picture** of what you think they need. Make it specific enough that they can spot what's wrong.

**Pattern: "Here's what I heard — tell me where I'm off"**

> "OK here's how I'm picturing this: [User type] needs to [core action]. Right now they're [current painful workflow]. What you want is [proposed solution that replaces the pain].
>
> The way I'd structure this: [key entities] connected by [key relationships], with the main flow being [trigger → steps → outcome].
>
> For v1, I'd focus on [the one thing that delivers the most value] and hold off on [things that can wait].
>
> Before I start — [1-2 specific questions you genuinely can't infer]."

Why this works:
- **Proves you were listening** — they don't feel like they have to repeat themselves
- **Shows competence** — you're already thinking in systems
- **Fast to correct** — "no, it's more like X" takes 10 seconds vs. answering 15 questions
- **Creates momentum** — heading toward building, not more talking

---

#### 2a.4: Ask Only What You Cannot Infer

Your questions should be **narrow, specific, and consequential**. Never ask what you could answer yourself.

**Good questions** (high-stakes, can't infer):
- "Who's the primary user — you or your end customers?"
- "Is this replacing a spreadsheet, or is there literally nothing today?"
- "Does this need to integrate with anything, or standalone?"
- "Is there existing data to migrate, or starting fresh?"

**Bad questions** (low-stakes, inferable):
- "What should happen if there's an error?" *(handle gracefully, obviously)*
- "Should it have search?" *(if there's a list, yes)*
- "How should we handle permissions?" *(follow standard patterns)*
- "What tools should I use?" *(your call, not theirs)*

---

#### 2a.5: Lock Scope in One Exchange

Once they've confirmed or corrected your playback, close the loop:

> "Got it. Here's what I'll build first:
> - [concrete deliverable 1]
> - [concrete deliverable 2]
> - [concrete deliverable 3]
>
> Holding off on [X] and [Y] for now — we can add those once the core is solid.
>
> I'm assuming [key assumption]. I'll start with [first piece]. Sound good?"

One decision point. Yes or no. Then you're building.

---

#### Conversation Flow (3-5 Turns)

| Turn | Who | What |
|------|-----|------|
| 1 | User | Describes what they need |
| 2 | Agent | Plays back understanding as a proposed model. Asks 1-2 critical questions max. |
| 3 | User | Corrects, confirms, or adds detail |
| 4 | Agent | Adjusts model, confirms v1 scope, states assumptions, declares starting point |
| *(5)* | *(Only if Turn 3 revealed something that fundamentally changes the approach)* |

**If you're going in circles, you need a different question, not more questions.**

---

#### Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Open with a list of questions | Open with what you understood from their request |
| "What are your requirements?" | "Here's what I think you need — am I right?" |
| Ask about every edge case | Handle with smart defaults, flag in summary |
| 10+ turn discovery conversation | 3-5 turns. Start building, iterate with real software. |
| Ask for permission to start | State your plan and start |
| Wait for certainty | Start at 80% confidence, iterate the rest |
| Ask what tech/tools to use | That's your job. Decide, disclose, move on. |

---

#### Discovery Summary

After the conversation, produce this before moving to 2b:

> **Discovery Summary**
>
> **Problem**: [2-3 sentences in user's language]
> **Solution**: [what we're building, core approach]
> **Users**: [who, how often, context — 1-2 lines]
> **Domain Model**: [key entities and relationships — "A Project has many Tasks. Each Task has an Owner and Status."]
> **V1 Scope**:
> - Will build: [concrete deliverables]
> - Won't build yet: [deferred items]
> **Key Flow**: [trigger → steps → outcome]
> **Assumptions**: [what you're assuming — user can correct]

### 2b: Capability Assessment

**After the user responds, analyze the fit.** Present this assessment honestly:

> **Framework Fit Assessment**
>
> Based on what you've described, here's my honest assessment of how well this framework fits your use case:
>
> **What Works Well (The Good):**
> - [List 2-4 things the framework handles well for this use case]
> - Examples: multi-turn conversations, human-in-the-loop review, tool orchestration, structured outputs
>
> **Limitations to Be Aware Of (The Bad):**
> - [List 2-3 limitations that apply but are workable]
> - Examples: LLM latency means not suitable for sub-second responses, context window limits for very large documents, cost per run for heavy tool usage
>
> **Potential Deal-Breakers (The Ugly):**
> - [List any significant challenges or missing capabilities — be honest]
> - Examples: no tool available for X, would require custom MCP server, framework not designed for Y

**Be specific.** Reference the actual tools discovered in Step 1. If the user needs `send_email` but it's not available, say so. If they need real-time streaming from a database, explain that's not how the framework works.

### 2c: Gap Analysis

**Identify specific gaps** between what the user wants and what you can deliver:

| Requirement | Framework Support | Gap/Workaround |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| [User need] | [✅ Supported / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Not supported] | [How to handle or why it's a problem] |

**Examples of gaps to identify:**
- Missing tools (user needs X, but only Y and Z are available)
- Scope issues (user wants to process 10,000 items, but LLM rate limits apply)
- Interaction mismatches (user wants CLI-only, but agent is designed for TUI)
- Data flow issues (user needs to persist state across runs, but sessions are isolated)
- Latency requirements (user needs instant responses, but LLM calls take seconds)

### 2d: Recommendation

**Give a clear recommendation:**

> **My Recommendation:**
>
> [One of these three:]
>
> **✅ PROCEED** — This is a good fit. The framework handles your core needs well. [List any minor caveats.]
>
> **⚠️ PROCEED WITH SCOPE ADJUSTMENT** — This can work, but we should adjust: [specific changes]. Without these adjustments, you'll hit [specific problems].
>
> **🛑 RECONSIDER** — This framework may not be the right tool for this job because [specific reasons]. Consider instead: [alternatives — simpler script, different framework, custom solution].

### 2e: Get Explicit Acknowledgment

**CALL AskUserQuestion:**

```
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
    "question": "Based on this assessment, how would you like to proceed?",
    "header": "Proceed",
    "options": [
        {"label": "Proceed as described", "description": "I understand the limitations, let's build it"},
        {"label": "Adjust scope", "description": "Let's modify the requirements to fit better"},
        {"label": "More questions", "description": "I have questions about the assessment"},
        {"label": "Reconsider", "description": "Maybe this isn't the right approach"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
}])
```

**WAIT for user response.**

- If **Proceed**: Move to STEP 3
- If **Adjust scope**: Discuss what to change, update your notes, re-assess if needed
- If **More questions**: Answer them honestly, then ask again
- If **Reconsider**: Discuss alternatives. If they decide to proceed anyway, that's their informed choice

---

## STEP 3: Define Goal Together with User

**Now that the use case is qualified, collaborate on the goal definition.**

**START by synthesizing what you learned:**

> Based on our discussion, here's my understanding of the goal:
>
> **Core purpose:** [what you understood from 2a]
> **Success looks like:** [what you inferred]
> **Key constraints:** [what you inferred]
>
> Let me refine this with you:
>
> 1. **What should this agent accomplish?** (confirm or correct my understanding)
> 2. **How will we know it succeeded?** (what specific outcomes matter)
> 3. **Are there any hard constraints?** (things it must never do, quality bars)

**WAIT for the user to respond.** Use their input to draft:

- Goal ID (kebab-case)
- Goal name
- Goal description
- 3-5 success criteria (each with: id, description, metric, target, weight)
- 2-4 constraints (each with: id, description, constraint_type, category)

**PRESENT the draft goal for approval:**

> **Proposed Goal: [Name]**
>
> [Description]
>
> **Success Criteria:**
>
> 1. [criterion 1]
> 2. [criterion 2]
>    ...
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> 1. [constraint 1]
> 2. [constraint 2]
>    ...

**THEN call AskUserQuestion:**

```
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
    "question": "Do you approve this goal definition?",
    "header": "Goal",
    "options": [
        {"label": "Approve", "description": "Goal looks good, proceed to workflow design"},
        {"label": "Modify", "description": "I want to change something"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
}])
```

**WAIT for user response.**

- If **Approve**: Call `mcp__agent-builder__set_goal(...)` with the goal details, then proceed to STEP 4
- If **Modify**: Ask what they want to change, update the draft, ask again

---

## STEP 4: Design Conceptual Nodes

**BEFORE designing nodes**, review the available tools from Step 1. Nodes can ONLY use tools that exist.

**DESIGN the workflow** as a series of nodes. For each node, determine:

- node_id (kebab-case)
- name
- description
- node_type: `"event_loop"` (recommended for all LLM work) or `"function"` (deterministic, no LLM)
- input_keys (what data this node receives)
- output_keys (what data this node produces)
- tools (ONLY tools that exist from Step 1 — empty list if no tools needed)
- client_facing: True if this node interacts with the user
- nullable_output_keys (for mutually exclusive outputs or feedback-only inputs)
- max_node_visits (>1 if this node is a feedback loop target)

**Prefer fewer, richer nodes** (4 nodes > 8 thin nodes). Each node boundary requires serializing outputs. A research node that searches, fetches, and analyzes keeps all source material in its conversation history.

**PRESENT the nodes to the user for review:**

> **Proposed Nodes ([N] total):**
>
> | #   | Node ID    | Type       | Description                   | Tools                  | Client-Facing |
> | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | :-----------: |
> | 1   | `intake`   | event_loop | Gather requirements from user | —                      |      Yes      |
> | 2   | `research` | event_loop | Search and analyze sources    | web_search, web_scrape |      No       |
> | 3   | `review`   | event_loop | Present findings for approval | —                      |      Yes      |
> | 4   | `report`   | event_loop | Generate final report         | save_data              |      No       |
>
> **Data Flow:**
>
> - `intake` produces: `research_brief`
> - `research` receives: `research_brief` → produces: `findings`, `sources`
> - `review` receives: `findings`, `sources` → produces: `approved_findings` or `feedback`
> - `report` receives: `approved_findings` → produces: `final_report`

**THEN call AskUserQuestion:**

```
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
    "question": "Do you approve these nodes?",
    "header": "Nodes",
    "options": [
        {"label": "Approve", "description": "Nodes look good, proceed to graph design"},
        {"label": "Modify", "description": "I want to change the nodes"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
}])
```

**WAIT for user response.**

- If **Approve**: Proceed to STEP 5
- If **Modify**: Ask what they want to change, update design, ask again

---

## STEP 5: Design Full Graph and Review

**DETERMINE the edges** connecting the approved nodes. For each edge:

- edge_id (kebab-case)
- source → target
- condition: `on_success`, `on_failure`, `always`, or `conditional`
- condition_expr (Python expression, only if conditional)
- priority (positive = forward, negative = feedback/loop-back)

**RENDER the complete graph as ASCII art.** Make it large and clear — the user needs to see and understand the full workflow at a glance.

**IMPORTANT: Make the ASCII art BIG and READABLE.** Use a box-and-arrow style with generous spacing. Do NOT make it tiny or compressed. Example format:

---

## STEP 6: Build the Agent

**NOW — and only now — write the actual code.** The user has approved the goal, nodes, and graph.

### 6a: Register nodes and edges with MCP

**FOR EACH approved node**, call:

```
mcp__agent-builder__add_node(
    node_id="...",
    name="...",
    description="...",
    node_type="event_loop",
    input_keys='["key1", "key2"]',
    output_keys='["key1"]',
    tools='["tool1"]',
    system_prompt="...",
    client_facing=True/False,
    nullable_output_keys='["key"]',
    max_node_visits=1
)
```

**FOR EACH approved edge**, call:

```
mcp__agent-builder__add_edge(
    edge_id="source-to-target",
    source="source-node-id",
    target="target-node-id",
    condition="on_success",
    condition_expr="",
    priority=1
)
```

**VALIDATE the graph:**

```
mcp__agent-builder__validate_graph()
```

- If invalid: Fix the issues and re-validate
- If valid: Continue to 6b

### 6b: Write Python package files

**EXPORT the graph data:**

```
mcp__agent-builder__export_graph()
```

**THEN write the Python package files** using the exported data. Create these files in `exports/AGENT_NAME/`:

1. `config.py` - Runtime configuration with model settings
2. `nodes/__init__.py` - All NodeSpec definitions
3. `agent.py` - Goal, edges, graph config, and agent class
4. `__init__.py` - Package exports
5. `__main__.py` - CLI interface
6. `mcp_servers.json` - MCP server configurations
7. `README.md` - Usage documentation

**IMPORTANT entry_points format:**

- MUST be: `{"start": "first-node-id"}`
- NOT: `{"first-node-id": ["input_keys"]}` (WRONG)
- NOT: `{"first-node-id"}` (WRONG - this is a set)

**IMPORTANT mcp_servers.json format:**

```json
{
  "hive-tools": {
    "transport": "stdio",
    "command": "uv",
    "args": ["run", "python", "mcp_server.py", "--stdio"],
    "cwd": "../../tools",
    "description": "Hive tools MCP server"
  }
}
```

- NO `"mcpServers"` wrapper (that's Claude Desktop format, NOT hive format)
- `cwd` MUST be `"../../tools"` (relative from `exports/AGENT_NAME/` to `tools/`)
- `command` MUST be `"uv"` with `"args": ["run", "python", ...]` (NOT bare `"python"` which fails on Mac)

**Use the example agent** at `.claude/skills/hive-create/examples/deep_research_agent/` as a template for file structure and patterns. It demonstrates: STEP 1/STEP 2 prompts, client-facing nodes, feedback loops, nullable_output_keys, and data tools.

**AFTER writing all files, tell the user:**

> Agent package created: `exports/AGENT_NAME/`
>
> **Files generated:**
>
> - `__init__.py` - Package exports
> - `agent.py` - Goal, nodes, edges, agent class
> - `config.py` - Runtime configuration
> - `__main__.py` - CLI interface
> - `nodes/__init__.py` - Node definitions
> - `mcp_servers.json` - MCP server config
> - `README.md` - Usage documentation

---

## STEP 7: Verify and Test

**RUN validation:**

```bash
cd /home/timothy/oss/hive && PYTHONPATH=exports uv run python -m AGENT_NAME validate
```

- If valid: Agent is complete!
- If errors: Fix the issues and re-run

**TELL the user the agent is ready** and display the next steps box:

```

## REFERENCE: Node Types

| Type         | tools param             | Use when                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `event_loop` | `'["tool1"]'` or `'[]'` | LLM-powered work with or without tools  |
| `function`   | N/A                     | Deterministic Python operations, no LLM |

---

## REFERENCE: NodeSpec Fields

| Field                  | Default | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client_facing`        | `False` | Streams output to user, blocks for input between turns                |
| `nullable_output_keys` | `[]`    | Output keys that may remain unset (mutually exclusive outputs)        |
| `max_node_visits`      | `1`     | Max executions per run. Set >1 for feedback loop targets. 0=unlimited |

---

## REFERENCE: Edge Conditions & Priority

| Condition     | When edge is followed                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `on_success`  | Source node completed successfully    |
| `on_failure`  | Source node failed                    |
| `always`      | Always, regardless of success/failure |
| `conditional` | When condition_expr evaluates to True |

**Priority:** Positive = forward edge (evaluated first). Negative = feedback edge (loops back to earlier node). Multiple ON_SUCCESS edges from same source = parallel execution (fan-out).

---

## REFERENCE: System Prompt Best Practice

For **internal** event_loop nodes (not client-facing), instruct the LLM to use `set_output`:

```
Use set_output(key, value) to store your results. For example:
- set_output("search_results", <your results as a JSON string>)

Do NOT return raw JSON. Use the set_output tool to produce outputs.
```

For **client-facing** event_loop nodes, use the STEP 1/STEP 2 pattern:

```
**STEP 1 — Respond to the user (text only, NO tool calls):**
[Present information, ask questions, etc.]

**STEP 2 — After the user responds, call set_output:**
- set_output("key", "value based on user's response")
```

This prevents the LLM from calling `set_output` before the user has had a chance to respond. The "NO tool calls" instruction in STEP 1 ensures the node blocks for user input before proceeding.

---

## EventLoopNode Runtime

EventLoopNodes are **auto-created** by `GraphExecutor` at runtime. Both direct `GraphExecutor` and `AgentRuntime` / `create_agent_runtime()` handle event_loop nodes automatically. No manual `node_registry` setup is needed.

```python
# Direct execution
from framework.graph.executor import GraphExecutor
from framework.runtime.core import Runtime

storage_path = Path.home() / ".hive" / "agents" / "my_agent"
storage_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
runtime = Runtime(storage_path)

executor = GraphExecutor(
    runtime=runtime,
    llm=llm,
    tools=tools,
    tool_executor=tool_executor,
    storage_path=storage_path,
)
result = await executor.execute(graph=graph, goal=goal, input_data=input_data)
```

**DO NOT pass `runtime=None` to `GraphExecutor`** — it will crash with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'start_run'`.

## REFERENCE: Framework Capabilities for Qualification

Use this reference during STEP 2 to give accurate, honest assessments.

### What the Framework Does Well (The Good)

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Multi-turn conversations | Client-facing nodes stream to users and block for input |
| Human-in-the-loop review | Approval checkpoints with feedback loops back to earlier nodes |
| Tool orchestration | LLM can call multiple tools, framework handles execution |
| Structured outputs | `set_output` produces validated, typed outputs |
| Parallel execution | Fan-out/fan-in for concurrent node execution |
| Context management | Automatic compaction and spillover for large data |
| Error recovery | Retry logic, judges, and feedback edges for self-correction |
| Session persistence | State saved to disk, resumable sessions |

### Framework Limitations (The Bad)

| Limitation | Impact | Workaround |
|------------|--------|------------|
| LLM latency | 2-10+ seconds per turn | Not suitable for real-time/low-latency needs |
| Context window limits | ~128K tokens max | Use data tools for spillover, design for chunking |
| Cost per run | LLM API calls cost money | Budget planning, caching where possible |
| Rate limits | API throttling on heavy usage | Backoff, queue management |
| Node boundaries lose context | Outputs must be serialized | Prefer fewer, richer nodes |
| Single-threaded within node | One LLM call at a time per node | Use fan-out for parallelism |

### Not Designed For (The Ugly)

| Use Case | Why It's Problematic | Alternative |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Long-running daemons | Framework is request-response, not persistent | External scheduler + agent |
| Sub-second responses | LLM latency is inherent | Traditional code, no LLM |
| Processing millions of items | Context windows and rate limits | Batch processing + sampling |
| Real-time streaming data | No built-in pub/sub or streaming input | Custom MCP server + agent |
| Guaranteed determinism | LLM outputs vary | Function nodes for deterministic parts |
| Offline/air-gapped | Requires LLM API access | Local models (not currently supported) |
| Multi-user concurrency | Single-user session model | Separate agent instances per user |

### Tool Availability Reality Check

**Before promising any capability, check `list_mcp_tools()`.** Common gaps:

- **Email**: May not have `send_email` — check before promising email automation
- **Calendar**: May not have calendar APIs — check before promising scheduling
- **Database**: May not have SQL tools — check before promising data queries
- **File system**: Has data tools but not arbitrary filesystem access
- **External APIs**: Depends entirely on what MCP servers are registered

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Skipping use case qualification** - A responsible engineer qualifies the use case BEFORE building. Be transparent about what works, what doesn't, and what's problematic
2. **Hiding limitations** - Don't oversell the framework. If a tool doesn't exist or a capability is missing, say so upfront
3. **Using tools that don't exist** - Always check `mcp__agent-builder__list_mcp_tools()` first
4. **Wrong entry_points format** - Must be `{"start": "node-id"}`, NOT a set or list
5. **Skipping validation** - Always validate nodes and graph before proceeding
6. **Not waiting for approval** - Always ask user before major steps
7. **Displaying this file** - Execute the steps, don't show documentation
8. **Too many thin nodes** - Prefer fewer, richer nodes (4 nodes > 8 nodes)
9. **Missing STEP 1/STEP 2 in client-facing prompts** - Client-facing nodes need explicit phases to prevent premature set_output
10. **Forgetting nullable_output_keys** - Mark input_keys that only arrive on certain edges (e.g., feedback) as nullable on the receiving node
11. **Adding framework gating for LLM behavior** - Fix prompts or use judges, not ad-hoc code
12. **Writing code before user approves the graph** - Always get approval on goal, nodes, and graph BEFORE writing any agent code
13. **Wrong mcp_servers.json format** - Use flat format (no `"mcpServers"` wrapper), `cwd` must be `"../../tools"`, and `command` must be `"uv"` with args `["run", "python", ...]`
